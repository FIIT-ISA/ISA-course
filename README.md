#  Intelligent System Applications (ISA_I)
- Aplikácie inteligentných systémov 

### Foundations of Generative AI and Applied Machine Learning
- Neural Recommender Systems
- Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning
 
By completing the course, students will gain knowledge about the development and deployment of real-world intelligent system applications. Through lectures, exercises and projects, students will cover the theory, practical knowledge of **foundation of generative AI** and skills that underpin **applied machine learning** in terms of building **intelligent system applications** with respect to **data protection**. The educational outcomes will provide students with the opportunity to enhance their understanding of machine learning specifics in application domains like e-commerce, monitoring systems, and remote sensing. Working on individual projects will encourage students to come up with their own ideas for implementing intelligent applications in both the **development** and **deployment** phases.

- Data and generative foundation of models
- Responsible AI, production-ready application design
- Practical use cases of Applied ML: recommender systems, AI-assisted systems
