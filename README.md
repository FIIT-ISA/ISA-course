#  Intelligent System Applications (ISA_I)
- Aplikácie inteligentných systémov 

### Foundation of Generative AI and Applied Machine Learning
- AI-Assisted Systems, RecSys, e-Commerce, e-Monitoring
- Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning
 
By completing the course, students will gain knowledge about the development and deployment of real-world intelligent system applications. Through lectures, exercises and projects, students will cover the theory, practical knowledge of **foundation of generative AI** and skills that underpin **applied machine learning** in terms of building **intelligent system applications** with respect to **data protection**. The educational outcomes will provide students with the opportunity to enhance their understanding of machine learning specifics in application domains like e-commerce, monitoring systems, and remote sensing. Working on individual projects will encourage students to come up with their own ideas for implementing intelligent applications in both the **development** and **deployment** phases.
