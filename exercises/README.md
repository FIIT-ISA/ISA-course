## Important Notice

> Project report submission is scheduled for:
> week 06 (1. mini-project),
> week 10 (2. mini-project),
> week 12 (3. mini-project).
>
> The pair will present their results to the instructor in a Jupyter Notebook. One member of the pair will then electronically submit the report to the AIS system by:
> **xx.10.202x 23:59** (1. mini-project),
> **xx.11.202x 23:59** (2. mini-project), 
> **xx.12.202x 23:59** (3. mini-projekt).
>
> If the submission deadline for the project phases and activities in AIS is missed, late submission is possible one week later, i.e., by:
> **xx.10.202x 23:59** (1. mini-project),
> **xx.11.202x 23:59** (2. mini-project), 
> **xx.12.202x 23:59** (3. mini-projekt)
> with a **50% penalty**.
> Later submission will not be accepted. Failure to submit any phase of the project or activities will result in not meeting the prerequisites for the exam (N).
