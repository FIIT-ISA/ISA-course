    "Keras is a powerful deep learning library that allows for easy and fast construction of neural networks. There are three main ways to build models in Keras:\n",
    "- Sequential API\n",
    "- Functional API\n",
    "- Model Subclassing (Object-Oriented Programming)\n",

    "In this notebook, we will explore each method, their use cases, and how they differ from one another.\n",

    "## Sequential API\n",

    "The Sequential API is the simplest way to create a model in Keras. It allows for the linear stacking of layers where each layer has exactly one input tensor and one output tensor.\n",

    "- Basic and easy to use.\n",
    "- Suitable for most deep learning models with a single input and output.\n",
