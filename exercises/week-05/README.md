# Ensemble Learning and Boosting

### Basic Ensemble Learning Techniques:
        - Max Voting
        - Averaging
        - Weighted Average

### Advanced ensemble learning techniques:
        - Stacking
        - Blending
        - Bagging
            - Random Forest
            - Extra-Trees (Extremely Randomized Trees)
            - Bagging Meta-Estimator
        - Boosting
            - AdaBoost
            - Gradient tree boosting
            - eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
