# Model-based Collaborative Filtering with Deep Learning
- Matrix Factorization for RecSys
- Embbeding layers for encoding
    - User Embeddings: Each user ID is mapped to a vector that captures the user's preferences and characteristics.
    - Item Embeddings: Similarly, each item ID is mapped to a vector that represents the item's features.
- Customized DL model
- PyTorch data loader
- Ranking by integrating a trained MatrixFactorization model with KMeans clustering to generate movie recommendations
