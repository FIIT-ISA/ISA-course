# Collaborative Filtering with Deep Learning
- Model-based Collaborative Filtering using following techniques
    - Matrix Factorization for Recommendation Systems
    - Embbeding layers
        - User Embeddings: Each user ID is mapped to a vector that captures the user's preferences and characteristics.
        - Item Embeddings: Similarly, each item ID is mapped to a vector that represents the item's features.
    - Customized Model
    - PyTorch Data Loader
    - Ranking by integrating a trained MatrixFactorization model with KMeans clustering to generate movie recommendations
